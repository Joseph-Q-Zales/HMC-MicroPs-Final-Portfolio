Below are videos to demonstrate the results of this project. **In short, it worked! Every ID card produces its own custom doorbell.**

The first video shows that each card generates its same doorbell everytime it is tapped.

The second video shows three different ID cards tapped to the PN532 RFID Reader. With volume on, you can hear that each generated doorbell is unique.
