# Schematics
<!-- Include images of the schematics for your system. They should follow best practices for schematic drawings with all parts and pins clearly labeled. You may draw your schematics either with a software tool or neatly by hand. -->

# Source Code Overview
<!-- This section should include information to describe the organization of the code base and highlight how the code connects. -->

The source code for the project is located in the Github repository [here](https://github.com/Joseph-Q-Zales/HMC-MicroPs-Final-Portfolio/tree/main/src).

# Bill of Materials
<!-- The bill of materials should include all the parts used in your project along with the prices and links.  -->
