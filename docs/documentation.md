# Schematics
<!-- Include images of the schematics for your system. They should follow best practices for schematic drawings with all parts and pins clearly labeled. You may draw your schematics either with a software tool or neatly by hand. -->

# Source Code Overview
<!-- This section should include information to describe the organization of the code base and highlight how the code connects. -->
The code base for this project is broken into three sections: 

* MCU code, written in C
* FPGA code, written in SystemVerilog
* FPGA testbenches, also written in SystemVerilog

The source code for the project is located in the Github repository [here](https://github.com/Joseph-Q-Zales/HMC-MicroPs-Final-Portfolio/tree/main/src).

## MCU Code
Our microcontroller code includes a multiple library files,  using the CMCIS structures, and a `main.c` file in which all of the library files are included. The library files are named `STM32L432KC_x.c` where x is the name of the peripheral driven by that library. For example, the I2C is used to communicate with the PN532 RFID/NCF Controller. The I2C driver is named `STM32L432KC_I2C.c`.

The `main.c` file calls functions from the various libraries and allows the MCU to act as the controller for both I2C (to the PN532) and SPI (to the FPGA).

### MCU Communication
The Nucleo microcontroller is at the heart of the project. It communicates via I2C with the PN532 NFC/RFID contoller using a set of multi-byte commands. See section **TODO** for details. It also communicates via one-directional SPI to the FPGA. 

From the RFID reader, the MCU extracts the UID from the RFID card, separates it into the bytes needed by the FPGA and sends 5 bytes of data, via SPI, to the FPGA.

## FPGA Code
The code to program the FPGA resides in one SystemVerilog file titled `main.sv`. The first module in this file, top, controlls the FGPA and calls the other modules as needed. 

The module entitled `tune` is the main finite state machine (FSM) for the FPGA. See section **TODO** for details. Below is the full netlist (all of the connections between modules) on the FPGA.

## FPGA Testbenches
A series of testbenches were created to test the FPGA prior to the integration with the MCU. 

Test benches created

* Testing SPI
* Testing the main FSM
* Testing frequency output
* Testing duration outputs
