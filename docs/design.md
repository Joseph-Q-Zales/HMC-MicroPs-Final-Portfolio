# MCU Design

# FPGA Design

At a high level, the FPGA is sent a set of data from the MCU, creates a set of frequencies and durations from that data ,and outputs the corresponding pulse width modulation (PWM) signal. When that PWM signal is connected to a speaker, a set of notes are played. 

To do this, the FPGA code is divided into three cascading sections: data received, data decomposed into frequencies and a PWM driver output. 

## Data Received from MCU
The first section, data received, is based on the SPI code from Lab 7 (implementing AES on an FPGA). For lab 7, 128-bits were sent to the FPGA via SPI, and after the FPGA had completed encrypting the data, it sent the encrypted data back. However, as the output of the FPGA goes to a speaker system instead of back to the MCU, the FPGA does not need to have the capability to send anything back via SPI to the MCU. From the MCU, the FPGA receives a 40-bit signal from which to decompose frequencies, durations and the number of times to repeat.

At its core, SPI is a shared shift register. This means that every signal input (a 1 or 0) shifts the previous inputs left by 1. Therefore, to create an SPI module on the FPGA, on the rising edge of the sck clock line from the MCU, a new bit of data was shifted into the register on the FPGA. At the end of 40 clock cycles (enough to push in the 40 bits), the chip enable (CE) goes from high to low signaling that the data can now be decomposed. 

## MCU Data Decomposed
The second section takes in the 5 8-bit signals and decomposes them. First, it bit swizzles the 40-bit signal into the frequencies, durations, and the number of times the tune repeats. See figure below for more details.
