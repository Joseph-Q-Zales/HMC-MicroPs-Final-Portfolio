# Inspiration
Our inspiration for this project was multifaceted. We wanted to create something unique, fun to use, and most importantly, something that would challenge us to step out of our comfort zone. This was an I2C communication link. While we had covered SPI and UART in our lectures, I2C was new to us. This pushed us to learn the communication protocol and implement it — all on our own. As RFID is becoming increasingly more popular, we also wanted to gain experience creating a system that utilizes this NFC technology. And with this, our RFID Doorbell project as born.
