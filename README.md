# MicroPs Final Project Portfolio
Ava Fascetti and Joe Zales's final project portfolio. The website generated by this repo can be found [here](https://joseph-q-zales.github.io/HMC-MicroPs-Final-Portfolio/).

Additionally, the source code included in this repository to program an STM32 microcontroller and a ICE40 UltraScale Plus FPGA.

## Abstract:
We have a vision of an RFID doorbell. Tap your RFID card to the reader at the entryway to a house and the doorbell will announce your unique set of tones to the resident. Perhaps the resident uses this information to welcome you to their home. Perhaps they use this information to turn off all the lights and pretend theyâ€™re not home. Regardless of how an end user would take this functionality, having a bit more knowledge of who is at your front door could prove beneficial in this increasingly interconnected world.
